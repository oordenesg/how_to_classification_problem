# how_to_classification_problem

This is an example of how to use Python libraries for classifications problems.  The aim of this notebook is to introduce you to the core concepts in developing and building a machine learning model, including:

1. An overview of Machine Learning;
2. An overview of the the Machine Learning workflow;
3. An introduction, through explanations and code, of the key machine learning libraries in python; and
4. Familiariry with the collaboratory environment
5. In each of the Machine Learning projects it is important to understand the workflow. This diagram summarizes the steps within these projects.

This is a `binary classification` problem, as we are training a model to differentiate between two different target classes, or categories. This is different from a `mutli-class classification` problem, which has more than two classes. The principles are the same, but the algorithms we use and the evaluation metrics can be different deoending on the type of problem.
